Place your .mp3 files inside the songs/ directory.

Create album folders:

For organizing songs into albums, create subfolders within the songs/ directory. Each album folder should contain:

Audio files (.mp3)

cover.jpg – Album cover image

info.json – Album information in JSON format

🐞 Known Issues
Ensure that the songs/ directory and its subdirectories are correctly structured to display albums and songs properly.
